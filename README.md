# Tag CRUD System Backend

A simple CRUD front-end web application created for challenge #2 of Thrive Pet Healthcare's interview project. Matching the requirements of the challenge, the application allows users to read and delete tags, however, full CRUD functionality is implemented, but not exposed to the user (because UI is painful).

### Tech stack:
- React
- Next.js
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Axios

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Initialize package manager and install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes
- The project was made with yarn, so if you want to use npm or any other package manager, you will need to migrate the project to the desired package manager.
